- [Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to VGA Adapter](https://amazon.com/dp/B00NH13I08/?tag=kentcdodds-20) - Wish I didn't need to just keep this around, but I do.

### [Home Stuff](#home-stuff)

- [Yootech \[2 Pack\] Wireless Charger](https://amazon.com/dp/B07MSFFDNP/?tag=kentcdodds-20) - Where I put my phone on my desk. The other one goes on my nightstand.
- [AmpliFi HD WiFi System by Ubiquiti Labs](https://amazon.com/dp/B01L9O08PW/?tag=kentcdodds-20) - This thing gives super fast internet speed, a huge range of connectivity, and the range extenders are fantastic. I'll never bother with anything else again.

- [Seagate IronWolf 10TB NAS Internal Hard Drive HDD](https://amazon.com/dp/B07H241VK4/?tag=kentcdodds-20) - The SSDs are _super_ expensive, so if you want a cheaper alternative (and more space) get these. I swapped these for the SSDs because they make a little mechanical clicking noise as the arms move around the disk and we could literally hear it all over the house (we have pretty sensitive hearing) and it was keeping us up at night. If you don't think that'll bother you or you have a better sound-proofing strategy, then grab these.
